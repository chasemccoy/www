## useReducer

You can use `useReducer` to simulate the old `this.setState({})` API of class components.

```jsx
const reducer = (state, newState) => ({
  ...state,
  ...newState
})

const Example = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

  setState({
    thisKey: 'will be merged into state'
  })

  return <div />
}
```

This ideas was stolen from this article:

## useReducer as a simple state machine

I love this simple trick from Kyle Shevlin.

## useStaticQuery & useSiteMetadata

I really like [this idea of wrapping up common queries in a Gatsby site into custom hooks](https://blog.scottspence.me/gatsby-custom-react-hook-for-site-metadata) that can be used to access things like your site's metadata.

## useTextContent

In JavaScript, you can use the `textContent` property of a node to get the text representation of the node and all of its descendent nodes. This isn't possible with a tree of React components, but you can fake it using a ref:

```jsx
const node = useRef(null)
const [textContent, setTextContent] = useState(null)

useEffect(() => {
  setTextContent(node.current.textContent)
}, [node])

return (
  <div ref={node}>
    This is text with a <a href='/'>link inside it</a>.
  </div>
)
```

In the code above, `textContent` is equal to the string `This is text with a link inside it.` This pattern could be very easily wrapped up into a custom hook:

```jsx
const useTextContent = (initial) => {
  const [textContent, setTextContent] = useState(initial)

  const ref = useCallback((node) => {
    if (node !== null) {
      setTextContent(node.textContent)
    }
  }, [])

  ref.current = textContent
  return ref
}

const textContainer = useTextContent(null)

return (
  <div>
    <SomeComponent ref={textContainer}>
      This is text with a <a href='/'>link inside it</a>.
    </SomeComponent>
    {textContainer.current}
  </div>
)
```
