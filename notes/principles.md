## Pay attention to what you pay attention to.

## Assume positive intent.

Not because people are good, but because of [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor): “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.”

## The web is a commonwealth.

It's also a marketplace. It's a place that breeds culture, but increasingly also breeds the negative side effects of commerce. It's up to use to make sure the web remains a place that's comfortable to occupy.

## Don't boil the ocean.

## If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing poorly.
