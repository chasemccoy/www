## Blogging is writing for myself

I'm not writing to impress or to inspire or to entertain or to teach. I'm not even writing because I have something to say—I'm writing to *find out* what I have to say.

> [...] you encounter this so often: the insistence that writing should be difficult, serious, painful. Blood on the page, all that. For many writers, it’s a key part of their mythologies of themselves.
> 
> And writing can be, very often is, all those things; so it’s not wrong.
> 
> It’s just incomplete, because writing can also be fun, matter-of-fact, rushed, bonkers, commercial, crass—and totally successful. Anything can work. Not everything does! But the gates of the city are wide open and there are a thousand ways in.

> Whenever I sit down in front of a keyboard I think of this now; I know that I can’t copy the tone and style of other people. And as much as I want to treat the writing seriously, and write something \~important\~, I probably shouldn’t. I ought to write as if I’m talking; hopeful, bumbling, hands-waving and heart-skipping all the way.
