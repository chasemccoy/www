excerpt: Embracing the history personal sites as ever growing and changing collections rather than static documents.

Digital gardens are conscious rejections of the web as a _stream_. They embrace a web which is non-ephemeral and builds value over time and with continued investment. 

Looking at a website this way also helps to "get rid of" the publish button, in that publishing frequently and without discretion is entirely the point.

[Maggie Appleton outline the six patterns of gardening:](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

1. Topography over timelines
2. Continuous growth
3. Learning in public and imperfection
4. Playful, personal, and experimental
5. Intercropping and content diversity
6. Independent ownership
