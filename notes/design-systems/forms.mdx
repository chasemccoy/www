# Takeaways from [_Form Design Patterns_ by Adam Silver](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/form-design-patterns/)

## Labels

From [Accessibility for Everyone by Laura Kalbag](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone), four parameters that improve user experiences for everyone:

- Visual: make it easy to see
- Auditory: make it easy to hear 
- Motor: make it easy to interact with 
- Cognitive: make it easy to understand 

Labels are one of the most important aspects of forms because of the way they serve these parameters. 

<p className='highlight'>By looking at labels from each of these standpoints, we can see just how important labels are. Sighted users can read them, visually-impaired users can hear them by using a screen reader, and motor-impaired users can more easily set focus to the field thanks to the larger hit area.</p>

Every form control _that accepts input_ should have a label. Things like submit buttons that don't accept input don't need a label (as long as they have text within them).

## Placeholders

Placeholder text is optional and always a nice-to-have. Any information that the user needs to fill in the form correctly should be text on the page (ideally below the label).

Example of this for a password field:

```html
<div class='field'>
  <label for='password'>
    <span class='field-label'>Password</span>
    <span class='field-hint'>Must contain 8+ characters with at least 1 number and 1 uppercase letter.</span>
  </label>
  <input type='password' id='password' name='password' />
</div>
```

## Question protocols

## Password fields

Add a button for password reveals so that you don't have to add a second password confirmation input and your users can still check their password before they submit the form.
