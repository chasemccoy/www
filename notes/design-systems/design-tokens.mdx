I really like [this quote from Jeff Eaton](https://twitter.com/eaton/status/1380174711053815813) on design tokens: 

> What I mean is that “design tokens” are a language for communicating intent between disparate parts of a system. By definition, that’s complex and nuanced work. It’s an attempt to make explicit and dependable something that has (in most publishing systems) been implicit and inconsistent. It faces all the challenges of language.

<p className='highlight'>If we think of our design system as a language, design tokens are the adjectives and adverbs.</p>
