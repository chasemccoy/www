excerpt: Often times, the source of truth in a system lies with the engineers, not the designers. Making sure devs can maintain the system is essential.

## Linting for product correctness

Inspired by [this tweet thread by Rafael Mendiola](https://twitter.com/GroundControl/status/1176512381519912961), where he describes the idea of creating custom ESLint plugin to enforce rules that help developers adhere to a design system.

It culminates in an example `eslint-plugin-design-system`:

And here's a good article on how to write custom ESLint plugins:

## SLDS Validator

The team behind the Salesforce Lightning design system [created an neat extension for VS Code](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/slds-vs-code-win-403d7edd22ac):

> SLDS Validator scans your markup, validates it against a database of guidelines/tips/gotchas/etc. extracted from the SLDS documentation, and offers suggestions on how to improve your code.

[And it's open source](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode-slds)!

## Splash zones

In this case, a "splash zone" refers to the parts of a system affected by a change to the system. If I edit a component, what other components are affected?

Some devs at Shopify have built a `yarn splash` command that determines the splash zone of changes to their component library:

Their tools is conveniently open sourced:
