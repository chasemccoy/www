1. **Never begin your day by sitting down at the computer first thing**  

    While I like being up and about in the morning, I'm not a morning person in the sense that my best creative or technical work happens early in the day. A sure-fire recipe for disaster for me is waking up and (after my morning routine) immediately sitting down in front of my work computer. 
2. **Practice productive procrastination**
3. **Have separate workspaces for your day job and your creative endeavors**
4. **Remember: if a thing is worth doing, it’s worth doing poorly**
5. **Don’t forget your mise en place**
