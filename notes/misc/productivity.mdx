1. **Never begin your day by sitting down at the computer first thing**  

    While I like being up and about in the morning, I'm not a morning person in the sense that my best creative or technical work happens early in the day. A sure-fire recipe for disaster for me is waking up and (after my morning routine) immediately sitting down in front of my work computer.  
    
    It’s much better for me to begin the day slowly and start by doing something enjoyable and inspiring like reading a good book or journaling, preferably over a cup of good coffee. Going for a walk or exercising in the morning is another good option.
2. **Practice productive procrastination**
3. **Have separate workspaces for your job and your extracurricular creative practices**
4. **Remember: if a thing is worth doing, it’s worth doing poorly**
5. **Don’t forget your mise en place**
