          <p>Pico Digital Film was a fun little camera app for iOS designed by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="http://louiemantia.com/">Louie Mantia</a> and built using Swift by yours truly. Pico Cam allowed you to pick from one of a few carefully crafted films, and shoot photos pre-processed with that film.</p>

          <p>Pico is no longer available for sale, and the domain for the website has expired. However, you can still <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190620065334/http:/pico.camera/">check out the site on the Internet Archive</a>. Louie also <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/@mantia/pico-digital-film-5ad232977394">wrote about the history of the project when it launched back in 2017</a>.</p>
