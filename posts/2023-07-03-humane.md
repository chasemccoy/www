[Humane](https://hu.ma.ne) (the mysterious company founded by ex-Apple executives) has finally revealed the name of the product they're hoping to ship this year: the **Humane Ai Pin**. 

I'm as skeptical as the next person about AI and wearables and really anything with as much hypebeast marketing as this product has received. But if I put my skepticism aside for a moment I'm able to appreciate this for what it isâ€”a group of people trying to create a new kind of computer and computing paradigm. 

There's [a bit of footage out there](https://www.inverse.com/tech/humane-ai-wearable-camera-sensor-projector-video-demo) of the device in action, but regardless of the specifics I think it's essential that we never stop asking ourselves what a computer could or should be.
