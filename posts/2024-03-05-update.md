A small programming note—I've updated my homepage to include highlights from articles and books I've read in addition to blog posts. The highlights are synced from my [Readwise](https://readwise.io/read) account. 

If you haven't used [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read), I highly recommend it. It's my modern replacement for Instapaper, and has a wonderful browser extension which allows for in-place highlighting of passages (including comments!) I am a very happy subscriber in part because of their excellent [API](https://readwise.io/api_deets).

The Readwise API combined with [Eleventy's fetch API](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/fetch/) made it a breeze to implement this new feature ✨
