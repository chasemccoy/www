I have a lot of nostalgia for the era of blogging I grew up within in the early 2000s. 

Of course there was a ton of great content about technology and internet culture, but more importantly to me it was a time of great commentary and thinking around the act of blogging and publishing itself. 

As social media and smartphones became a part of our everyday lives, there was a group of bloggers online rejecting those feeds and constructing their own forms. Before Twitter apps and podcast clients became the UI playgrounds of most designers, there was a great deal of innovation in how content could be self-published online. 

Looking back, this is probably where my meta-fascination with the web came from. Understanding and analyzing the medium itself was always the most interesting use of that medium for me. 

Robin Sloan puts it well (as he does most things):

> Back in the 2000s, a lot of blogs were about blogs, about blogging. If that sounds exhaustingly meta, well, yes — but it was also SUPER generative. When the thing can describe itself, when it becomes the natural place to discuss and debate itself, I am telling you: some flywheel gets spinning, and powerful things start to happen.

Design, programming, and writing all started for me because of the web. I can recall the progression from a plain text editor to the Tumblr theme editor to learning self-hosted WordPress and then working with Jekyll, so on and so forth.

All of that was driven by the need to tinker and experiment with the web as a medium. How many ways could you design a simple weblog? What different formats were possible that no one had ever imagined before? 

Earlier this week I listened to [Jason Kottke's recent appearance on John Gruber's podcast](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/03/11/ep-370) and was delighted to hear them discuss this very topic. ason is one of the original innovators of the blog form, and I've been following his blog, kottke.org, since I was old enough to care about random shit on the internet.

Kottke.org turned *25 years old* this week, and Jason has been blogging online for even longer than that. And all along the way, he has experimented with the form of content on the web. He's not alone in that—many bloggers like him have helped to shape the form of the internet. The ones that cinfluenced me besides kottke.org are [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net), [Waxy.org](https://waxy.org), Jim Coudal and [Coudal Partners](http://www.coudal.com), [Shawn Blanc](https://shawnblanc.net), [Rands in Repose](https://randsinrepose.com/), [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/), and more that I'm certainly forgetting.

Jason and John have an interesting conversation during the podcast (starting around 25 minutes in) about how the first few generations of bloggers on the web experimented with the form and shaped how we all interact with the web today. This largely stemmed from the material differences between print and digital mediums. 

It's important to remind ourselves that the things we take for granted today on the web and in digital design had to be invented by someone. An example discussed in the podcast are early weblogs which broke content up into "issues" or changed the content of their homepage on certain days to feature a single post. 

It wasn't until later that the reverse-chronological, paginated scrolling list of entries was introduced and eventually became the de-facto presentation of content on the web. That standard lives on today in the feeds of sites like Twitter and Instagram, and it's fascinating to see that tradition fading away as more sites embrace algorithmic feeds. 

Jason summarized this effect well when referring to the early bloggers at suck.com:

> [...]there was in information to be gotten from not only what they linked to, but how they linked to it, which word they decided to make the hyperlink.

The hyperlink was like a new stylistic new primitive for the written word. For decades you could bold, italicize, underline, uppercase, footnote, etc. and all of a sudden something entirely new—the hyperlink.

There was a time when I considered blogging as a potential career, and in the process of exploring that I found my way to design and software.

Write a blog, take great care of how it is presented, experiment with form as much as well as content.
