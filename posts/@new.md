Matt Webb's [Interconnected](https://interconnected.org) is my favorite recent RSS subscription. He wrote a post recently called ["Don’t keep your eye on the ball but prime your intuition"](https://interconnected.org/home/2022/07/01/focus), and within it I saw myself and the way I work reflected.

> Now I can think of my sketching and designs in a different way: I am training my intuition. I am *not* deciding what to do. I am priming myself such that, when a decision *needs* to be made (when I’m building or somebody asks me for feedback or when I’m putting together the plan for what to build next), I automatically respond the right way in the instant.

As I become a more seasoned systems designer, I find the nature of my work shifting. I used to think that being a senior designer meant figuring out all of the details up front, and having a plan that the team could follow to-the-letter in order to achieve success. This is not remotely realistic.

Working on design systems at scale means a constantly shifting landscape of requirements. Often times, the more we plan ahead the more of a disservice we do to the information we're gathering daily.

Being effective doesn't mean knowing all the answers. It means listening, watching, and waiting. Biding your time, collecting knowledge, exploring ideas. And then, when the moment comes to make a critical decision, you have primed yourself (and hopefully the people around you) with the context to make the right call.

Austin Kleon put this perfectly when he said that "creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing." Of course, you're not really doing nothing. You're scouting the field.
