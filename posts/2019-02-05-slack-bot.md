title: Slack bots for design systems
---

I had an idea during a meeting today—what if we had a Slack bot that looked for common key words and phrases and suggested content from our design system? About twenty minutes later I had a prototype of this running and installed in our Slack workspace, and it is all thanks to [Botkit](https://www.botkit.ai/) and their `[botkit-slack](https://glitch.com/~botkit-slack)` Glitch project.

Shout out to [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) for being incredible. I was able to remix the Botkit project and have my own version running in seconds. The app features a pretty ingenious interactive setup guide that walks you through the configuration by having you input your API keys and then giving you the exact values to paste into Slack's app site and the Glitch editor. The process was flawless and a perfect example of a developer experience that just works.
