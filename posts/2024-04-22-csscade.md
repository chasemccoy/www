Hearty congrats to Robin Rendle who has turned his wonderful CSS-focused newsletter into a good, old fashioned blog. [The Cascade](https://www.csscade.com) is beautiful, and is already full of great content for CSS nerds like me.

The site is, generously, free to read, but [member supported](https://www.csscade.com/why-membership) for $10/year. Subscribing, for me, was an absolute no brainer. 

I liked this bit from [an issue of Robin’s personal newsletter](https://buttondown.email/robinrendle/archive/lightness-in-publishing) that he sent after the launch:

> There’s not enough words in the English language to describe how cool it is to build a little publishing machine. That rare, lightning-in-a-bottle feeling of throwing a few services together and building something greater than the sum of its parts.  

It’s never been easier to create a website (a publishing machine!) for yourself or your interests. The feeling of ownership you’ll have compared to publishing on someone else’s platform is a powerful force in and of itself.
