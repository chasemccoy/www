excerpt: Memorializing Anthony Bourdain and all of the things we can learn from him.

I don't have the words to describe what we've lost in Anthony Bourdain. Instead, I thought I would share some things that I love about him. The first that comes to mind is his first visit to a Waffle House:

He had some beautiful words on Chicago, the city I love.

[Eater also has a great write-up on Bourdain's thoughts on Chicago](https://chicago.eater.com/2018/6/8/17441456/anthony-bourdain-chicago-quotes-no-reservations-layover-part-known).

And, of course, there's [the infamous New Yorker piece that led to _Kitchen Confidential_](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/04/19/dont-eat-before-reading-this).

Anthony had a way of writing that was simultaneously eloquent and effective while avoiding snobbery and pretense.

He used his influence and stature for good, and ultimately that's what I will remember the most about him. R.I.P.
