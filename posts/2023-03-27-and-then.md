There's a lot of talk right now about AI, automation, work, and art. A lot of people are afraid that AI might displace them. 

Some other people are excited to use AI to get more done in less time. They're using it to summarize readings, transcribe videos, and assist with research. The idea being to get through the boring parts of creating as fast as possible. 

[Alan Jacobs wrote a post](https://blog.ayjay.org/and-then) which was a good reminder for me that those parts  _shouldn't_ be boring if you're doing them for the right reasons, and the goal isn't always to go as quickly as possible. It's good to take your time. A desire to get through those parts quickly might suggest you should be doing something else entirely.

> My question about all this is: And then? You rush through the writing, the researching, the watching, the listening, you’re done with it, you get it behind you — and what is in front of you? Well, death, for one thing. For the main thing.

An AI apocalypse indeed.
