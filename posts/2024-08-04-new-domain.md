Programming note: the domain for this website has changed! chasem.co is out, and **[chsmc.org](/)** is in. 

All existing links and feeds should redirect automatically, because [good URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI), but please let me know if you see otherwise. 

Why the switch? A few things:

- Pronouncing my email address (@chasem.co) always resulted in spelling it out anyway, and "do you mean .com?" was a frequent response.
- `chsmc` is increasingly the handle I'm using online whenever `chase` is not available (so, most of the time).
- The equivalent .com was too expensive, and the .net is taken.
- I was inspired by some of the great blogs I read that use .org domains. [kottke.org](https://kottke.org), [marco.org](https://marco.org), [waxy.org](https://waxy.org), [macwright.org](https://macwright.org), [pketh.org](https://pketh.org) all come to mind.

My hope is that this is a move to my *forever domain*, but if someone at JPMorgan Chase wants to chat about donating a better domain, they can find me (and so can you) at [hi@chsmc.org](mailto:hi@chsmc.org)
