title: How blogs shaped the web

I have a lot of nostalgia for the era of blogging that I grew up with during the first decade or so of the 2000s.

Of course there was a ton of great content about technology and internet culture, but more importantly to me it was a time of great commentary and thinking around the form of blogging and publishing itself.

As social media and smartphones became a part of our everyday lives, there was a group of bloggers online rejecting those feeds and constructing their own forms. Before Twitter apps and podcast clients became the UI playgrounds of most designers, there was a great deal of innovation in how content could be self-published online.

Looking back, this is probably where my meta-fascination with the web came from. Understanding and analyzing the medium itself was always the most interesting use of that medium for me.

Robin Sloan puts it well (as he does most things):

> Back in the 2000s, a lot of blogs were about blogs, about blogging. If that sounds exhaustingly meta, well, yes — but it was also SUPER generative. When the thing can describe itself, when it becomes the natural place to discuss and debate itself, I&nbsp;am telling you: some flywheel gets spinning, and powerful things start to&nbsp;happen.

Design, programming, and writing all started for me because of the web. I can recall the progression from a plain text editor to the Tumblr theme editor to learning self-hosted WordPress and then working with Jekyll, so on and so forth.

All of that was driven by the need to tinker and experiment with the web's form. How many ways could you design a simple weblog? What different formats were possible that no one had ever imagined before?

Earlier this week I listened to [Jason Kottke's recent appearance on John Gruber's podcast](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/03/11/ep-370) and was delighted to hear them discuss this very topic. Jason is one of the original innovators of the blog form, and I've been following his blog, kottke.org, since I was old enough to care about random shit on the internet.

[Kottke.org turned _25 years old_ this week](https://kottke.org/23/03/kottke-is-25-years-old-today), and Jason has been publishing online for even longer than that. All along the way, he has experimented with the form of content on the web. He's not alone in that—many bloggers like him have helped to shape the form of the internet. The ones that influenced me besides kottke.org are [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net), [Waxy.org](https://waxy.org), Jim Coudal and [Coudal Partners](http://www.coudal.com), [Shawn Blanc](https://shawnblanc.net), [Rands in Repose](https://randsinrepose.com/), [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/), and more that I'm certainly forgetting.

Jason and John have an interesting conversation during the podcast (starting around 25 minutes in) about how the first few generations of bloggers on the web shaped the form of the web we know today. This largely stemmed from the material differences between print and digital mediums.

It's important to remind ourselves that the things we take for granted today on the web and in digital design had to be invented by someone. Examples discussed in the podcast are early weblogs which broke content up into "issues", or ones that simply changed the content of their homepages entirely.

It wasn't until later that the reverse-chronological, paginated scrolling list of entries was introduced and eventually became the de-facto presentation of content on the web. That standard lives on today in the feeds of sites like Twitter and Instagram, and it's fascinating to see that tradition fading away as more sites embrace algorithmic feeds.

By the way, I'd be remiss here if I didn't mention Amy Hoy's amazing piece [How the blog broke the web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web). Comparing the title of her piece with the title of this one, it's clear that not everyone sees this shift in form as a positive one, but she does a great job in outlining the history and the role that blogs played in shaping the form of the web. Her particular focus on early content management systems like Movable Type is fascinating.

Another great example that Jason and John discuss on the podcast is the idea of titling blog posts.

They point out that many early sites didn't use titles for blog posts, a pattern which resembles the future form of Tweets, Facebook posts, text messages, and more. But the rise of RSS readers, many of which made the assumption that entries have titles and design their UIs around them, forced many bloggers to add titles to their posts to work well in the environment so popular with their readers.

This is an incredible example of the medium shaping the message, where the UI design of RSS readers heavily influenced the form of content being published. When optimizing for the web, those early bloggers and the social networks of today both arrived at the same conclusion—titles are unnecessary and add an undue burden to publishing content.

Wen referring to the early bloggers at suck.com, Jason said something that I think describes this entire revolution pretty well.

> [...]there was in information to be gotten from not only what they linked to, but how they linked to it, which word they decided to make the hyperlink.

It's not often that you have an entirely new stylistic primitive added to your writing toolbox. For decades you could bold, italicize, underline, uppercase, footnote, etc. and all of a sudden something entirely new—the hyperlink.

With linking out to other sites being such a core part of blogging, it's no surprise that the interaction design of linking was largely discussed and experimented with. [Here's a post from Shawn Blanc](https://shawnblanc.net/2009/08/the-link-post) discussing all the ways that various blogs of the time handled posts primary geared towards linking to and commenting on other sites.

Another similar example is URL slugs—the short string of text at the end of a web address identifying a single post. For many of my favorite bloggers, the URL slug is a small but subtle way to convey a message that may _or may not be_ the same as the message of the post itself. One other stylistic primitive unique to the web.

There was a time when I considered blogging as a potential career, and in the process of exploring that I found my way to design and software.

Write a blog, take great care of how it is presented, experiment with form as much as well as content.
