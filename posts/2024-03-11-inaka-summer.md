I've been obsessed for longer than I can remember with the question of what it means to love something on the internet. 

Animal Crossing, which debuted the year after Boku no Natsuyasumi, is often held up as the shining example of cozy, low-stakes video games. I love playing Animal Crossing games, but they stand in stark comparison to a game like Boku no Natsuyasumi with their gameplay literally focused on grinding in order to pay your landlord. Animal Crossing rewards completionists, and in doing so makes itself the focus rather than the player. 

And so here I am, on the internet, reviewing a review of an obscure video game released 24 years ago in Japan about a boy's summer break in the countryside. And I feel a sense of both nostalgia and longing.
