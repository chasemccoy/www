title: Action Button reviews Boku no Natsuyasumi
hidden: true

What does it mean to love something on the internet? That's a question I think about quite a lot. The best way to answer it might be with examples. 

Several months ago in an issue of Spencer Chang's newsletter I discovered the video review of a game called Boku no Natsuyasumi by Tim Rogers (known as Action Button). To call this a review is surely stretching the limits of the word's meaning as we know it.

Boku no Natsuyasumi is a game for the original PlayStation released exclusively in Japan in the year 2000. It centers on a boy spending a month long summer vacation in the countryside of Japan during August of the year 1975. 



Animal Crossing, which debuted the year after Boku no Natsuyasumi, is often held up as the shining example of cozy, low-stakes video games. I love playing Animal Crossing games, but they stand in stark comparison to a game like Boku no Natsuyasumi with their gameplay literally focused on grinding in order to pay your landlord. Animal Crossing rewards completionists, and in doing so makes itself the focus rather than the player. 



Action Button's review of the game is a perfect example of how to love something on the internet, and there are plenty of other people expressing their love for this simple game online.

And so here I am, on the internet, reviewing a review of an obscure video game released 24 years ago in Japan about a boy's summer break in the countryside. And I feel a sense of both nostalgia and longing.
