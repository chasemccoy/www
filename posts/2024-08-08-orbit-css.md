I'm fascinated by the way that CSS, as it becomes more powerful, can be used as a [visual language for representing the physical world](/2024/06/css-music-time). Combined with the longevity of the web, which strives to never break backwards compatibility, it's a powerful tool for sending information into the future. 

Here's another example I stumbled on: [Orbit is a CSS framework for radial constructs](https://zumerlab.github.io/orbit-docs). It provides an easy way to arrange elements around and within a circular area. 

I grew up dreaming about the esoteric user interfaces seen in science fiction films, many of which featured circular screens, control panels, and UIs. Now we can achieve those with CSS!

I also love the whimsical nature of Orbit's API, which requires a single "big bang" element on the page, and uses a "gravity-spot" class for creating an area with a radial layout. The library comes with support for adding orbits, slices, satellites, capsules, and more around user-defined gravity spots.
