I stumbled upon a great site which acts as an explainer for vanilla web development techniques called, well, [Plain Vanilla](https://plainvanillaweb.com).

When I was starting out as a developer I had a hard time learning the basics of the web platform because so many resources and examples used a framework. It was mostly jQuery at the time, and today I'd assume React and Tailwind are the most common starting points for new developers.

But the web has come a long way! A framework might not be necessary for lots of projects, and going as far as you can with the grain of the web comes with lots of benefits. I'm happy to see a high quality resource like this that can help folks avoid complexity and start simple.
