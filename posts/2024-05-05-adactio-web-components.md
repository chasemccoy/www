I really appreciated [this write up from Jeremy Keith about his personal approach and best practices for HTML web components](https://adactio.com/journal/21078).

Judging by the discourse, web components seem to be gaining in popularity lately, and I'm very here for it. 

Trying to build on the web using a component model was what led me (and others I'm sure) into the arms of React many years ago. While I'm grateful for that journey, and still believe React is the right choice for many projects, it gives me a lot of comfort to know there's a native tool I can reach for. 

The tricky thing with web components, like the web platform in general, is the flexibility. What makes it so powerful can also make it hard to learn, and even harder to know if what you're learning is the right or recommended path. It takes time for best practices to form and percolate.
