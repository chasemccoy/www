[The Browser Company of New York](https://thebrowser.company/) is building a new web browser called Arc, and they recently shared a preview of a new feature called "Boosts".

Boosts are a built in way to remix the web by writing your own code (JavaScript or CSS) that runs when when you visit a website. Check it out:

Look at that! The webpage on the right is raw material for the creativity on the right. They've even build in visual editing tools such as a color picker. 

Webpages have always been destinations, but what if they were more like blank canvases, inviting you to extend and reimagine them in whatever way you see fit? 

It has always been possible to run user scripts and styles via browser extensions, but I've never seen it integrated seamlessly and directly into the browser. Arc even implies that working with the web might be just as important as browsing itâ€”in Arc's interface, the Boost editor sits at the same level as the page you're browsing, not in some nested panel that feels secondary to the experience.
