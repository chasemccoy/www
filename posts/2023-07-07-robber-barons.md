We're seeing a surge of platforms [self-sabotaging](https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-now-needs-users-sign-view-tweets-2023-06-30/) and [choosing to suddenly restrict access to their content](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges). These are all blatant attempts to trap users by digging a moat around the communities that they've created. 

I can think of 3 obvious reasons why this might all be happening now as opposed to any time over the past decade:

1. The content on social media platforms is valuable for AI training, and platforms want to capitalize on or keep that value for themselves. 
2. The recent, high-interest-rate environment has companies cutting costs in ways they might not before, and subsidizing API access for third party developers is no longer a bill they're willing to foot.
3. The bad behavior of platforms is creating a more competitive environment as new challengers spring up ([Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), [Posts](https://posts.cv/), [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/) all come to mind).

Those *seem* obvious, but are they really the cause? Is it one more than the other? Or something else entirely? 

I wonder how much of this trend is really just a domino effect of CEOs realizing that they can get away with screwing over their users because they saw Elon Musk (or some other robber baron) get away with it.
