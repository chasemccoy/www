All designers have an origin story, and mine is rooted in a childhood obsession with fictional and futuristic interfaces. I watched science fiction not for the story or characters, but for a glimpse at what a computer could be. 

One of my favorites was Star Trek and the LCARS (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System) interface for the ship's computers. Here is an interface that breaks free from the rectangle! It uses lots of colors and sounds! It's fantastic. 

So I was delighted to see that [Jim Robertus has brought LCARS to the web as a free to use, responsive  HTML and CSS template](https://www.thelcars.com). It even comes with sound effects.

I can't wait to find a reason to build something with this.
