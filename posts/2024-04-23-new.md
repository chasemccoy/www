In the chaos of building your design system—getting buy in, designing components, architecting design tokens—don’t forget the reason you’re doing all of that work in the first place. 

A design system whose maintainers don’t regularly use the system to solve problems is doomed.

Don’t worship the work. Instead, revel in the good that can be done by applying the work.
