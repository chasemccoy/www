For how much software has evolved and matured, I often find it strange how many small jobs to be done remain unaddressed by niche, purpose-built software. I’m always excited to see how novel ideas can come about from focusing in on a very narrow domain.

[Ink and Switch’s latest research prototype](https://www.inkandswitch.com/embark) focuses on one very specific task: making travel plans. It brings the features of multiple apps into a single workspace. 

> Although apps give us access to all kinds of information, they provide only limited mechanisms for bringing it together in useful ways. Whenever a complex task requires multiple apps, we are forced to juggle information across apps, resulting in tedious and error-prone coordination work.

Interestingly Embark leverages a plain text document in an outliner format as its medium, enriching it with additional UIs as needed. 

This work, along with the recent AI-ification of interfaces, make it clear that the written word is hard to beat when it comes to human-computer (or even human-human) interactions. 

There is something both deeply distressing but also blissfully serene about the fact that improving upon a text file is nearly impossible
