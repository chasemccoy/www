Here's something unexpected: Keanu Reeves and China Mi√©ville (one of my favorite science fiction authors) are writing a book together that's dropping in July. [The Book of Elsewhere](https://thebookofelsewhere.com) is described as a "genre-bending epic of ancient powers, modern war, and an outcast who cannot die." Sign me up.

Speaking of books being released this year, Robin Sloan's new novel [Moonbound](https://www.robinsloan.com/moonbound) will land in June. Preorder a copy and [let Robin know](https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/leverage/#moonbound) to receive a limited edition zine.

Summer beckons!
