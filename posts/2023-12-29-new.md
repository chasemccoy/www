title: The pleasure of observing
hidden: true

I've been thinking a lot lately about the work that I do (design systems) and why that type of work is so damn difficult.

To distract myself from that during the holiday break I decided to read a book focused on an unrelated topic. *Field Notes on Science and Nature* is a book about TKTK

Of course, influence and inspiration often comes from unexpected places. Despite my intention, I found myself nodding along to many passages and relating to them in terms of my own work.

If this sort of work doesn't seem interesting to you, then you might not enjoy working on design systems.
