title: Boku no Natsuyasumi
hidden: true

What does it mean to love something on the internet? That's a question I think about quite a lot. Sometimes I come across a shining example. 

Several months ago in [an issue of Spencer Chang's newsletter](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-09-the-internet-is-one-big-video) I discovered [the 6 hour video review of a game called Boku no Natsuyasumi by Tim Rogers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=779coR-XPTw) (known as Action Button). To call this a review is surely stretching the limits of the word's meaning as we know it.

Boku no Natsuyasumim (shortened as Bokunatsu) is a game for the original PlayStation released exclusively in Japan in the year 2000. It centers on a young boy, Boku, spending a month long summer vacation in the countryside of Japan during August 1975. Players can explore the countryside as Boku, collect bugs, fish, fly kites, and other things you might expect of a child on summer break. 

Sounds simple, but watch Tim's review and you'll see that the game is really a subtle masterclass in menu design, cinematography, typography, skeuomorphism, Japanese culture, sound design, storytelling, memory, and even mortality. 

I became determined to experience the game myself, which is easier said than done given that it was never released outside of Japan. I managed to find [an English patch](https://www.patreon.com/posts/boku-no-2-patch-92070798), translated by a fan, for the game's sequel Boku no Natsuyasumi 2: Umi no Bouken-hen (My Summer Vacation 2: Sea Adventure Chapter). The sequel, released two years after the original, also follows a boy named Boku vacationing in the countryside in August of 1975. 

Armed with the patch file, I needed 3 more items to complete my quest: a PS2 emulator, a PS2 BIOS (the software pre-installed on the console's chipset), and a copy of Boku no Natsuyasumi 2.

Luckily the emulator is easy to come by: I discovered [the excellent PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net), which is an open source PS2 emulator that works quite well on my MacBook Air. 

Unfortunately, for Legal Reasons™ I cannot provide a link to the PS2 BIOS or the the game itself, but needless to say that a cursory Google search should turn up the files you need without too much trouble.

With these 4 talismans in hand I was able to perform the ritual of resurrection: apply the English patch to the game, boot up the PS2 emulator, load the game. After a few clicks: paydirt.

This must be the internet equivalent of what breaking open an ancient, hidden tomb must feel like.

I haven't been able to connect and use my PS5 controller, but luckily PCXS2 takes care of mapping the controls to keyboard input. Combined with the game's simple control scheme, I haven't had any any trouble playing on my laptop. 

It's clear to me, from my time playing this iteration and from Tim's review, that these games are undoubtedly works of art. They also happen to be an example of some of the billions of bytes of lost media that are sitting there waiting to be rediscovered by someone who will appreciate them. Here is a game, published 22 years ago, that has managed to evoke feelings of nostalgia and wistfulness in me today, in 2024. This must be the closest thing to time travel I'll ever experience. 

I of course knew lots about the game before playing due to Tim's review (which, again, is a 6 hour masterpiece), but there are two aspects I couldn't fully appreciate until playing: the backgrouns and the soundscapes. 

First, the backgrounds. Boku uses a fixed perspective for any given scene, meaning that the camera only changes angles when the character moves to another area. Each area that the user can move through is backdropped with a *gorgeous* hand-painted image. If you've ever seen a Miyazaki film you have a sense for the feelings that these backdrops create. A 3D modeled scene would never have evoked such a strong sense of place, time, and character, and the creative decision to use hand drawn backgrounds makes all the difference.

There's a narrative purpose to the backgrounds as well, signaling the time of day as they change throughout between different paintings for day, afternoon, and night. 

The backgrounds were done by artists at an animation studio called Kusanagi. [Here are the backgrounds they made for Bokunatsu 2](https://www.kusanagi.co.jp/art/detail.php?id=%E3%81%BC%E3%81%8F%E3%81%AE%E3%81%AA%E3%81%A4%E3%82%84%E3%81%99%E3%81%BF2&img=4&category=game), but I heartily encourage you to browse through all of the art on their site.

Kazuo Oga is a famous background painter and the person responsible for many of the backgrounds in your favorite Miyazaki films. [Animation Obsessive had this to say about him](https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/what-kazuo-oga-thinks-about-when): 

> That’s really the heart of it. Oga notices things — little things. He gets a feel for them. When he sits down to work, he brings with him all the unimportant details that matter the most. Then, with his paint, he creates an artwork that centers those details, elevates them. It’s more a way of seeing and feeling than it is a technique.

All the unimportant details that matter the most—this is exactly what makes the backgrounds in Bokunatsu so key to the experience, and why computer modeled environments lack.

The backgrounds are complimented by the soundscapes. These are, in my opinion, the best part of the game. Of all the characteristics of summer, it may be the sounds which I most associate with the the season. I grew up in the rural south, and Bokunatsu manages to capture the sultry sounds of summer in a way I've never experienced before in media. 

[According to interviews with the creator and director of the games](https://scroll.vg/extras/summer-vacation-confidential), Kaz Ayabe, Sony sent a team into the mountains to capture sounds for the game, and that effort paid off. The game's environment is alive with the sounds of insects chirping, the wind blowing through a nearby chime, the trickling of a nearby stream. As Boku explores time advances and, just like the background art, the sounds change to signal morning, afternoon, and night. 




Animal Crossing, which debuted the year after the original Boku no Natsuyasumi game, is held up as the shining example of cozy, relaxing video games. I am a true fan of the Animal Crossing franchise, but with its gameplay literally focused on grinding in order to pay your landlord they stand in stark comparison to a game like Bokunatsu. Animal Crossing rewards completionism, and in doing so makes the game about grinding instead of actually relaxing. In comparison, the only thing you'll get for collecting all of the bugs or catching all of the fish in Boku is a diary entry written by the boy at night before bed. And, like real life, maybe that's all we really need?



Action Button's review of the game is a perfect example of how to love something on the internet, and there are plenty of other people expressing their love for this simple game online.

And so here I am, on the internet, reviewing a review of an obscure video game released 24 years ago in Japan about a boy's summer break in the countryside. And I feel a sense of both nostalgia and longing.



When writing in his diary, Boku reflects on "the most wonderful day in which nothing happened."
