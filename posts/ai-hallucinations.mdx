I've had many people ask me what I think about the rise of AI generated art/prose/design, and so far I have mostly hedged on my answer. 

I wonder what happens as the data sets of AIs such as ChatGPT start being fed with more content generated by AIs. Current AIs are generating responses that are largely based on the works of humans. Humans of course are not exempt from this, as they too have subconscious influences that shape their work without even them being aware. But humans have more than influencedâ€”they have experiences. Real life moments that affect their emotions and how they interpret the world. An AI has none of that, it has only the influences. But does that matter? 

Great artists steal and remix, but aren't AIs capable of remix as well? Yes, but they're not capable of mixing experiences in.
