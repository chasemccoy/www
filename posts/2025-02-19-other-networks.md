Here's something that checks all kinds of boxes for me: Lori Emerson has a gorgeous new book coming soon (April) called Other Networks: A Radical Technology Sourcebook, which you can [preorder now from publisher Mexican Summer](https://shop.mexicansummer.com/merch/495898-lori-emerson-other-networks-a-radical-technology-sourcebook).

> *Other Networks* is writer and researcher Lori Emersonâ€™s speculative index of communications networks that existed before or outside of the internet: digital as well as analog, IRL as well as imagined, state-sponsored systems of control as well as homebrew communities in the footnotes of hacker culture.

You would be hard pressed to purposely conceive of a book more squarely aimed at my niche interests. And the book itself is a beautiful hardcover tome, rife with archival imagery as well as original artwork. Instant preorder material right here.

By the way, I discovered Mexican Summer and Lori's book by way of [Claire Evans on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/theuniverse.bsky.social/post/3liictc36f22p), a site I am spending more time on as of late. [Join me, won't you?](https://bsky.app/profile/chsmc.me)
