title: Between process and vision
---

Throughout my career as a designer, I've experienced a recurring struggle with the concept of process.

I used to look at process as something sacred: a holy calculus through which I could find the right answer to a problem every time. All I needed to do was remember the steps and apply them in *just* the right way. Wash, rinse, repeat. 

Maybe this idea stems from my background in programming, or maybe it's just an attempt to comfort my own fears and insecurities, but I wanted my work to follow a clearly defined algorithm. 

I know now that's an illusion. 

[Jenny Wen recently wrote a great piece about this](https://jennywen.substack.com/p/dont-trust-the-design-process). I'll quote a bit of it here:

> The way I’ve seen great work made isn’t using any sort of design process. It’s skipping steps when we deem them unnecessary. It’s doing them out of order just for the heck of it. It’s backtracking when we’re unsatisfied. It’s changing things after we’ve handed off the design. It’s starting from the solution first. It’s operating on vibes and intuition. It’s making something just for the sake of making people smile. It’s a feeling that we nailed it.

For me, overly relying on process might also have been borne out of a distaste for what I perceive to be the opposite of process: vision. Blue sky design visions, if not done with care, can turn into uninformed expressions of ego and hubris.

If you've worked within a large design organization, you've probably seen this play out. A designer, usually one with lots of tenure or clout, goes heads down to produce a north star for the design direction of a product that is usually impressive but disconnected from both the needs of users and the realities of building real software.  

Visions too often fall out of a coconut tree, not existing within the context of the current product or what came before it. <small>(Sorry, I had to.)</small>

Of course, vision work can be useful as an instigating factor: to excite stakeholders, secure funding, or drive alignment by raising key questions. But too often these visions are taken more seriously than they should, and they get handed down to other teams in place of an actual roadmap. 

I think that the act of designing and shipping real solutions happens somewhere in between process and vision. It's not a carefully defined algorithm, and it's not a moonshot.

So how might we talk about that in between state?

I recently read an excellent piece by Henrik Karlsson called [Everything that turned out well in my life followed from the same design process](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/unfolding). Henrik discusses what Christopher Alexander referred to as _unfolding_:

> If you want to find a good design—be that the design of a house or an essay, a career or a marriage—what you want is some process that allows you to extract information from the context, and bake it into the form. That is what unfolding is.

Click through for a more details explanation of how unfolding works.

Henrik goes on to say that unfolding is the opposite of vision, but I like to think of vision and rigidly defined process as two ends of a spectrum, with unfolding sitting somewhere in the middle.

> The opposite of an unfolding is a vision. A vision springs, not from a careful understanding of a context, but from a fantasy: if you could just make it into _another_ context your problems will go away.

None of this is to say that there is no place for more formal processes. When unfolding a problem we need to establish feedback loops and respond to those in a way that resembles improv, but the act of responding may itself leverage repeatable processes. 

We might choose to think about these recurring patterns in our work as frameworks, which are applied to solve specific problems or answer certain questions. 

For example: unfolding a problem might present a difficult decision that needs to be made, and that's when leveraging a decision making framework might be useful. 

Should every decision that needs to be made have that framework applied to it? Absolutely not! And it's our job as designers to know what parts of our work should be scripted and what parts should be improvised. 

I'm trying to let go of my conditioning to attack every problem with process, and these ideas are helping me frame my work in a way that invites spontaneity and is less concerned with artifacts of the work that _aren't_ actual software. Because at the end of the day, any artifact that isn't the product itself should be in service of the product, not any one person's process.
