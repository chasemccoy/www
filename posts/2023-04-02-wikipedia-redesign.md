My favorite read from this past weekend was [Alex Hollender's design notes on the 2023 redesign of Wikipedia](https://alexhollender.com/wikipedia-2023-redesign), which is a perfect example of how terrifying design can be when it means changing something that lots of humans use and rely on every day.

The process and challenges outlined here are fascinating in and of themself. Wikipedia is a set of decentralized interfaces which differ across all 318 supported languages, and those interfaces had been diverging since the last major design was put in place 15 years ago. That, combined with a lack of deep analytics data to pull from, adds up to quite a design challenge. 

Let's take a moment to acknowledge that 15 years is quite a tenure for the design of one of the most consistently and highly visited sites on the web. I've often taken the Wikipedia interface for granted, not expected or even realizing it was capable of change. In a way the constant visual design has contributed to its encyclopedia-ish-ness, evoking a sense of trust, stability, and longevity.
