Matt Webb's [Interconnected](https://interconnected.org) is my favorite recent RSS subscription. He wrote a post recently called ["Don’t keep your eye on the ball but prime your intuition"](https://interconnected.org/home/2022/07/01/focus), and within it I saw myself and the way I work reflected. 

> Now I can think of my sketching and designs in a different way: I am training my intuition. I am *not* deciding what to do. I am priming myself such that, when a decision *needs* to be made (when I’m building or somebody asks me for feedback or when I’m putting together the plan for what to build next), I automatically respond the right way in the instant.

> [...] I can see now that I’m no longer *meant* to be right with my sketches. I’m not *supposed* to be straight to the point. What I’m doing is scouting the field; I’m loading up my unconscious with everything it needs to make the right choice later, intuitively.
