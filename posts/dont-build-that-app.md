**[Luke Jackson on the Formidable blog: Don't Build That App! â†’](https://formidable.com/blog/2019/no-build-step)**

Luke shares how you can develop a React app today with no build step by taking advantage of the platform's latest features. 

This doesn't excite me because it will change the way that we build apps (it likely won't for a while), but because of how it will change a developer's ability to get started creating new websites that use tools like React. In the not-too-distant future, "vanilla" web development will look a lot like how we develop the web at scale. The barrier of entry will be lower than ever before.
