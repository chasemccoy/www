Lately I've been thinking a lot about design systems documentation, and and more importantly how we scale knowledge and best practices across a large team. Looking at most design system documentation (including design systems I've built), you'll see something that heavily resembles the documentation you might find for a standalone product or software library. 

We're used to writing and reading long, linear documents full of content structured from top-to-bottom. I think that this content is actually far more useful in small chunks that are individually addressable.

Design systems can offer products, and some of those may be software libraries, but a design system is not only a product or a library. Good systems are hyperobjects that capture decisions, language, patterns, history, and all of the things that make and _have made_ your organization's design what it is. They resemble knowledge graphs far more than products, and I'd like to see some of the emerging patterns around software for managing a knowledge graph applied to design systems. 

What is a knowledge graph? [The best formal definition I found was this one](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-a-knowledge-graph/):

> The knowledge graph represents a collection of interlinked descriptions of entities – objects, events or concepts. Knowledge graphs put data in context via linking and semantic metadata and this way provide a framework for data integration, unification, analytics and sharing.

The best way to think about how a knowledge graph can be represented in software form are tools like [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and to some degree (with their new synced blocks feature) [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). There are also individuals experimenting with these concepts, such as [Andy Matuschak's personal notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org)

These tools pull from a long history of ideas that can tie their origins to the creation of hypertext itself. But the original vision of hypertext is not really like the hypertext of today's web. Pioneers like Ted Nelson imagined a hypertext where links aren't only one way, and where information can be referenced and embedded across many contexts. (By the way, [Devon Zuegel did a wonderful interview with Ted Nelson for Notion](https://www.notion.so/blog/ted-nelson).)

Unfortunately, we didn't get Ted Nelson's vision for hypertext with the web. Many of the reasons documentation on the web today is so limited is due to the limitations of the medium itself. Despite that, there are tools and sites popping up that give us a look at some of these ideas implemented on the web. 

Knowledge graph systems that make specific ideas addressable unlock some interesting ideas that I think could be applied to documentation (not only, but especially, for design systems).

## Transclusion 

When content is stored in its minimum viable format and can be referenced in another piece of content it becomes possible to "transclude" or embed the content directly.

Imagine all of the pieces of a design system that could individually encoded:

- Styles
- Tokens
- Components
- Patterns
- Guidelines
- Properties
- Content
- Icons 
- Illustrations 

Wherever these concepts are mentioned in our document, they could instead be _transcluded_.

## Bidirectional links

Bidirectional links build on transclusion by making the original piece of content _aware_ of where it is being referenced throughout the graph. 

There are many ways in which bidirectional links would benefit a design system. If every part of our system is encoded as a knowledge graph, then styles, tokens, components, patterns, guidelines, properties, and more can be linked together. 

Consider a Button component, which imports and used an Icon component. This dependency within the system is like a link in a knowledge graph in that it's bidirectional. If I view the documentation for Button, I want to see that it consumes Icon. And if I view the documentation for Icon, I want to see that it's consumed by Button (and whatever other components).

## Identifying concepts with links

There are many concepts within our design systems that do not yet exist, and yet we know that they're there and that they will exist in the future. Knowledge graph apps like Roam and Obsidian let you create a new object in your graph by simply naming it and linking to it. 

This is very similar to the concept of "red links" on Wikipedia, which represent linked-to pages that don't yet exist. [Here's what the Wikipedia entry has to say about Wikipedia's red links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Red_link): 

> The creation of red links prevents new pages from being orphaned from the start. Good red links help Wikipedia—they encourage new contributors in useful directions, and remind us that Wikipedia is far from finished.

## Queries 

While this may be more of a application of knowledge graphs than a direct feature of them, it's a powerful concept demonstrated by Roam Research's query feature. In Roam, you can create queries for concepts in the graph using complex logical operators. The results are transcluded into the page where the query is performed. 

This concept, if applied to documentation, would allow the user to query the knowledge graph that is our design system. For instance, a designer might want to query `icons AND (onboarding OR first use)` to see all of the icons in the system used within onboarding and first use experiences. 

I'd love to see a future where, instead of browsing a documentation site to learn about a design system, we could ask questions of the system directly and receive answers and relevant resources immediately.

[Roam's white paper](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/dZ72V0Ig6) gives a good description of the benefits of representing information as a knowledge graph:

> Users can connect similar ideas in multiple overlapping hierarchies, remix them without overwriting the original context, and selectively share parts of the graph with others to collaborate on specific sub-questions.

Imagine a design system that allows designers and developers to connect, remix, and share ideas collaboratively.

Rather than representing concepts and objects by writing documents about them, we should find ways to model and encode them into the smallest units possible—units that are addressable and can be embedded wherever is appropriate.
