History of my interactions with Twitter, how the community and the software shaped my life's trajectory.

The quality of interactions in the spaces we create is entirely our own responsibility. Like hosting a party.

Twitter now reminds me of a dying mall.

Users shaped the platform in its early days by inventing retweets, @ mentions, etc.

When will everyone realize how absurd all of this is and treat it with the derision it deserves.

Centralized social media dominated the market, and drove most users away from forums and blogs and onto their platforms. People want to be where their friends are, and everyone’s friends moved to the toxic hellsites.

We live in the most absurd future https://twitter.com/verge/status/1605331153682063361
