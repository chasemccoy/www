title: Pay attention to Chicago 
---

I've felt compelled to write something about what it's like living in Chicago during the moment we find ourselves in now, but luckily [Dan Sinker wrote a piece that I can simply link to and quote here](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-10-24-understand):

> What I need you to understand is that nobody is letting them go quietly. The Feds' every movement is announced by a chorus of whistles, by a parade of cars honking in their wake, neighbors rushing outside to yell to film to witness these kidnappings that are unfolding in front of us. Neighbors running *towards* trouble.

Like Fred Rogers said, "[look for the helpers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LGHtc_D328)"

Don't miss the resources at the end of Dan's post about how to contribute your time and/or money. Chicago has always been a bellwether for the country: of dangers to come and hope to be found.
