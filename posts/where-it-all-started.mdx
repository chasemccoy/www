I remember the first time I saw a Mac in person. I was in elementary school, but on the campus of the nearby college because my dad had a gig as a stand-in drummer for a local band. 

I was hanging out backstage—something I often had the privilege of doing from a young age as the son of a drummer—and I saw a girl, sitting on the ground, typing away on a brand new MacBook Air. 

The Air had just been introduced to the world, and I remember reading about it online. Steve Jobs had walked on stage with a manilla envelope, opened it, and pulled out the thinnest computer I had ever seen. I had no idea a computer could even look like that.

The new M2 MacBook Air is a dark slab of compute, and it feels dense and book-ish in a satisfying way that I've never felt in a computer before.
