I remember the first time I saw a Mac in person. I was in middle school, but on the campus of the nearby college because my dad had a gig as a stand-in drummer for a local band. 

I was hanging out backstage—something I often had the privilege of doing from a young age as the son of a drummer—and I saw a girl, sitting on the ground, typing away on a brand new MacBook Air.

The Air had just been introduced to the world, and I remember rewatching the announcement video online. Steve Jobs talked about the computer at Macworld only to reveal that it had been on stage with him the entire time inside a manilla envelope. He opened it and pulled out the thinnest computer in the world. I had no idea a computer could even look like that. 

After my dad's show I immediately pointed out the girl and her computer, and I remember him sharing my excitement so much that he asked the girl if we could look at it a bit closer. She was kind and happy to show it off and even let me hold it. From then on, I was hooked. I knew that's the computer I'd own one day, and sure enough I'd get my first Mac, a MacBook Air, a few years later in high school.

And now, a MacBook Air thinner than the original iPhone. 

The new M2 MacBook Air is a dark slab of compute, and it feels dense and book-ish in a satisfying way that I've never felt in a computer before.

In all honesty I thought the time had come when a computer could not longer really excite me in the way that original MacBook Air did. But, this new one takes me right back there. It reminds me how lucky we all are to carry around devices that can conjure up all sorts of magic. 

My life and friends and relationships and career are all in there, wound up with the electrons, a warm glow drawing us like moths to a flame.
