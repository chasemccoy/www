title: Antibuildings
---

We all have our own [antilibrary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilibrary), the books we buy with the best intentions of reading but never quite get around to. For architects, a similar concept might be the sketches and plans that never leave the drawing board: antibuildings?

I'd venture to say there's likely as much to learn in studying the antibuildings of great architects as there is in studying those works that have been fully realized.

Frank Lloyd Wright left behind a treasure trove of antibuildings (582 that we know of!), and artist David Romero has been creating digital models based on their plans as part of a project called [Hooked On The Past](http://www.hookedonthepast.com/). That includes [The Illinois](http://www.hookedonthepast.com/mile-high-illinois): FLW's ambitious plan for a mile-high skyscraper in downtown Chicago that would have been twice the height of the Burj Khalifa.

[Colossal has a great interview with David](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/06/david-romero-frank-lloyd-wright) about his work that features some additional structures I didn't see on the official website or [Flickr page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/143771393@N04/albums).
