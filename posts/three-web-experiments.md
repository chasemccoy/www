The fall of Twitter has been likke writing on the wall for some time now, and I found myself frequently wondering what some other web might feel like.

Imagine a web just for you. A web owned and operated by you, maintained with love and care and without relying on third party dependencies or third party platforms. A web that will never sunset or get acquired or sell your data. 

It's funny how that web was the entire purpose of the whole thing, and yet so many of us rarely experience that it anymore. I wanted a web I could mold to my experiences and needs.

So I asked myself what spaces I'd like to inhabit when I'm on the web. The magic of the web for me has always been about discovering new things, publishing independently, and trying to plot the unplottable.

Tom Critchlow has frequently discussed the concept of "digital bricolage", and that concept is so core to my love for the web.

Bricolage is “the skill of using whatever is at hand and recombining them to create something new.” This is why the web is such a powerful creative tool—it puts at hand a set of incredible tools to build _and_ distribute with.

Over the past year I've worked on three small web experiments that center around 

1. Discovering things on the web
2. Writing about things I find on the web 
3. Connecting and storing the things I find on the web

My hope is to construct a homestead on the web, tucked away amongst the streams.

## Microcosm

It's easier to find a needle in a smaller haystack. Microcosm is my personal haystack.

Discovering content during the early days of the internet was like exploring a new territory. There was a growing amount of content to see, but it was not very densely linked and thus harder to discover. The trails had not yet been plotted on the map.  

Some explorers set out to solve that. Ontologists go to work exploring, classifying, and categorizing the web to not only help others find their way, but also to try to better understand the nature of the web itself.

Broadsheet was inspired by [the summer of Spring '83](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/specifying-spring-83/#summer).
