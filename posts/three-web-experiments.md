Tom Critchlow has frequently discussed the concept of "digital bricolage", and that concept is so core to my love for the web.

Bricolage is “the skill of using whatever is at hand and recombining them to create something new.” This is why the web is such a powerful creative tool—it puts at hand a set of incredible tools to build _and_ distribute with.

Over the past year I've worked on three small web experiments that center around 

1. Discovering things on the web
2. Writing about things I find on the web 
3. Connecting and storing the things I find on the web

Broadsheet was inspired by [the summer of Spring '83](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/specifying-spring-83/#summer).

Faulkner (named after another writer from Mississippi) is powered by the web [file system access APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API).
